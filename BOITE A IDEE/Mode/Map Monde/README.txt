# Summary

Wood world maps are getting more and more popular but are really expensive while the production with a laser cutter is very simple.

I found a nice CC0 world map design on wikipedia which I simplified. This means I removed some small island, combined bigger islands or even attached an island to a continent. This will make the mounting to the wall a lot easier.

After that I nested the entire world into one sheet of 1200x600mm. This saves wood but keep in mind that by doing that not all countries now have the same wood grain direction.
I also added some extra stuff since there was some space left.

It was quite hard to remove all the unwanted wood after the laser cutting. Next time I would add some extra cutting lines so that the wast is easier to remove.
