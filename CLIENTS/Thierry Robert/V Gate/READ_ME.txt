Both parts have been precision crafted in 3D software

these parts have been designed to be printed on a 200 micron 3D printer

which is equal to 0.2mm.

Many hours has gone into the creation of these two parts,

especially the actual magnet drum holder with literally 100s of test prints to get it where

we are today.

I have decided to now make these parts freely available to anyone who wishes

to download them and print them off for themselves.


**********

I would request that these files be made only available from my website kv5.uk

and NOT be shared or uploaded to any 3D printing platforms or the likes

I hope you understand this and respect my wishes.
